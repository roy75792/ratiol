  I put golden ratio facts here.
</p>
<p>
  What IS the golden ratio?
  The golden ratio is the
  divine mathematical constant
  holding our universe together.

⁦48°51'10"N⁩ ⁦2°20'59"E⁩,
⁦37°58'17"N⁩ ⁦23°43'32"E⁩,
⁦27°10'25"N⁩ ⁦78°02'31"E⁩,
⁦29°58'38"N⁩ ⁦31°07'57"E⁩

  This is the golden spiral.
  It is created by taking a golden rectangle,
  constructing a square on it's shorter segment,
  and repeating through all the smaller golden rectangles formed.
  then, you connect all the points with a single curve, which is the golden spiral.

<p>
  other places you may find the golden ratio, or atleast, the fibonacci sequence are pineapples, artichokes, or sunflowers.
</p>
<p>
  you see, when you count the amount of spirals going to the left, and the amount of spirals going to the right, these 2 values will always be fibonacci numbers.

  above is a picture of lily seeds forming 34 clockwise spirals and 21 counterclockwise.
</p>
<p>
  take the first letter of each location, in order. that is the key.
